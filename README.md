# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, we leverage the eCommerce dataset available on Kaggle ([Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)) to build a Customer Segmentation model using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis method.

RFM segmentation proves to be a robust technique widely employed by businesses to categorize customers based on their recent purchasing behavior, purchase frequency, and monetary value. This segmentation empowers organizations to tailor marketing and customer engagement strategies, ensuring a more personalized and effective approach.

## Objective

The primary objective in this project is to conduct RFM analysis on the provided dataset and subsequently segment the customers into distinct groups based on their RFM scores. These segmented groups will offer valuable insights for crafting targeted marketing campaigns and formulating customer retention strategies.
